    *  Problem: At the moment, the appointment book program saves data in a default file (unless you tell it to create a different one), but it doesn't save it as the new schedule object that you create.  For instance, in one session I type "cows = Schedule.new", then enter some events for cows.  Then I sign off, and sign on later, and create a new Schedule object, ducks.  But when I call up the events for ducks, it gives me all the events that I added for cows, as well!  And it doesn't recognize cows as a schedule object anymore.

    * Solution: I would like to have the default setting be to save a file by the name of the new Schedule object, instead of having one single default file.  (I know this happens because I'm doing it in irb partly.  If I write the new schedule object into an actual file, it will remember it.  But I'd like to be able to save it from irb, because of course this is a command-line application.)  Or, if it uses a default file, to save each Schedule object separately, so that it doesn't save all the values together in a single hash and return all the events ever entered into the file.

    * For the above problem, if I wanted to include something in initialize that would tell it to save a file under the name of the newly created Schedule object, how would I refer to that object? (i.e. when you open irb and require "appointmentbook", then say for instance "cows = Schedule.new".  How can you get it to save a file "cows.store", and then open that file and access that data later?)

Problems

   1. How to save each new Schedule object in its own default file
   2. How to open that file later to view/save things in
